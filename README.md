NOT OFFICIAL, NOT RELATED TO THE RAPTOREUM CORE TEAM

-----------------------------------

Powershell script to apply a Bootstrap to the Raptoreum Core Wallet and update to the latest version, on Windows 10.

Available in English, in French, and in Spanish:

https://github.com/wizz13150/RaptoreumStuff/releases/tag/RTMBootstrap

Just run the .bat and answer the questions if you're using custom folders.

*Need to run the .bat as admin if you want to update your Raptoreum Core Wallet.

-----------------------------------

If it's a fresh installation, be sure to launch Raptoreum Core once, before running this script. A wallet folder must already exist.

-----------------------------------

What the script does :

-Check the latest versions of Raptoreum Core on github, the latest bootstrap on bootstrap.raptoreum.com, with links to download.

-Detect your Raptoreum Core version, or ask for a custom folder.

-If you are not up to date, will ask if you want to update Raptoreum Core to the latest version available.

-Use the default wallet location, or ask for a custom folder.

-Detect if 7-Zip is on the computer, +30% faster for the extraction.

-Download, proceed to a checksum verification and apply the last bootstrap (no index) available to your wallet. 

*If you want to use your local (up to date) bootstrap.zip, put it in your wallet folder.

Take 10 min to complete, for me. (03/23)

Enjoy.
