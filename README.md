NOT OFFICIAL, NOT RELATED TO THE RAPTOREUM CORE TEAM

-----------------------------------

Powershell script to apply a Bootstrap to the RaptoreumCore Wallet, on Windows 10.

Available in English, in French, and in Spanish:

https://github.com/wizz13150/RaptoreumStuff/releases/tag/RTMBootstrap

Just run the .bat and answer the questions if you're using custom folders.

*Need to run the .bat as admin if you have to update your RaptoreumCore Wallet.

-----------------------------------

If it's a fresh installation, be sure to launch Raptoreum Core once, before running this script. A wallet folder need to exist.

-----------------------------------

Check the latest versions of RaptoreumCore on github, the latest bootstrap on bootstrap.raptoreum.com, with links to download.

Will apply the last bootstrap (no index) available to your wallet, be sure to run the last RaptoreumCore release version. 

Use the default wallet location, or ask for a custom folder.

Detect if 7-Zip is on the computer, +30% faster for the extraction.

Detect your RaptoreumCore version, or ask for a custom folder.

If you want to use your local (up to date) bootstrap.zip, put it in your wallet folder.

Take 10 min to complete, for me. (03/23)

Enjoy.
