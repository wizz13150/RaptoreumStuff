NOT OFFICIAL, NOT RELATED TO THE RAPTOREUM CORE TEAM

-----------------------------------

Powershell script to apply a Bootstrap to the RaptoreumCore Wallet, on Windows 10.

Just run and answer the questions if you're using custom folders.

-----------------------------------

Check the latest versions of RaptoreumCore on github, the latest bootstrap on bootstrap.raptoreum.com, with links to download.

Will apply the last bootstrap (no index) available to your wallet, be sure to run the last RaptoreumCore release version. 

Use the default wallet location, or ask for a custom folder.

Detect if 7-Zip is on the computer, +30% faster for the extraction.

Detect your RaptoreumCore version, or ask for a custom folder.

If you want to use your local bootstrap.zip, put it in your wallet folder.

Take 10 min to complete, for me. (03/23)

Enjoy.
