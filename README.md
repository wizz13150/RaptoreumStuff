Powershell script to apply a Bootstrap to the RaptoreumCore Wallet, on Windows 10.

Just run and answer the questions if you're using custom folders.

-----------------------------------

Check the latest versions of RaptoreumCore on github, the latest bootstrap on bootstrap.raptoreum.com, with links to download.

Will apply the last bootstrap (no index) available to your wallet, be sure to run the last RaptoreumCore release version. 

Detect if 7-Zip is on the computer, 30-50% faster.

Take 10 min to complete, for me. (03/23)

Enjoy.
